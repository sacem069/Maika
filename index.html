				<blockquote>
					How is ugly to be defined in the current postmodern design climate where existing systems are up for
					re-evaluation, order is under attack and the forced collision of disparate forms is the rule?
				</blockquote>

				<p>For the moment, let us say that ugly decision, as opposed to classical design (where adherence to the
					golden mean and a preference for balance and harmony serve as the foundation for even the most
					unconventional compositions) is the layering of unharmonious graphic forms in a way that results in
					confusing messages. </p>
				<p>By this definition, Output could be considered a prime example of <span class="rub">ugliness</span> in the service of
					fashionable experimentation. Though not intended to function in the commercial world, it was
					distributed to thousands of practicing designers on the American Institute of Graphic Arts and
					American Center for Design mailing lists, so rather than remain cloistered and protected from
					criticism as on-campus ‘research’, it is a fair subject for scrutiny. It can legitimately be
					described as representing the current cult of ugliness.</p>
				<p>The layered images, vernacular hybrids, low-resolution reproductions and cacophonous blends of
					different types and letters at once challenge prevailing aesthetic beliefs and propose alternative
					paradigms. Like the output of communications rebels of the past (whether 1920s Futurists or 1960s
					psychedelic artists), this work demands that the viewer or reader accept non-traditional formats
					which at best guide the eye for a specific purpose through a range of non-linear ‘pathways’, and at
					worst result in confusion.</p>
				<p>But the reasons behind this wave are dubious. Does the current social and cultural condition involve
					the kind of upheaval to which critical ugliness is a time-honoured companion? Or in the wake of
					earlier, more serious <span class="rub">experimentation,</span> has ugliness simply been assimilated into popular culture and
					become a stylish conceit?</p>
				<p>The current wave began in the mid-1970s with the English punk scene, a raw expression of youth
					frustration manifested through shocking dress, music and art. Punk’s naïve graphic language – an
					aggressive <span class="rub"> rejection </span> of rational typography that echoes Dada and Futurist work – influenced
					designers during the late 1970s who seriously tested the limits imposed by Modernist formalism.
					Punk’s violent demeanour surfaced in Swiss, American, Dutch and French design and spread to the
					mainstream in the form of a ‘new wave’, or what American punk artist Gary Panter has called
					‘sanitised punk’. </p>
				<p>A key anti-canonical approach later called <a class="link"
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Wave_(design)#:~:text=In%20design%2C%20New%20Wave%20or,set%20at%20non%2Dright%20angles."
						target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Swiss Punk </a> which in comparison with the
					gridlocked Swiss International Style was menacingly chaotic, though rooted in its own logic - was
					born in the mecca of rationalism, Basel during the late 1970s. For the elders who were threatened
					(and offended) by the onslaught to criticise Swiss Punk as ugly was avoiding the issue.</p>
				<p>Ugly design can be a conscious attempt to create and define alternative standards. Like warpaint, the
					dissonant styles which many contemporary designers have applied to their visual communications are
					meant to shock an enemy – complacency – as well as to encourage new reading and viewing patterns.
					The work of American designer Art Chantry combines the shock-and-educate approach with a concern for
					appropriateness. For over a decade Chantry has been creating eye-catching, low-budget graphics for
					the Seattle punk scene by using found commercial artefacts from industrial merchandise catalogues as
					key elements in his posters and flyers. While these ‘unsophisticated’ graphics may be horrifying to
					designers who prefer Shaker functionalism to punk vernacularism, Chantry’s design is decidedly
					<span class="rub">  functional within its context.</span></p>

		<p> What I value most from the text is that it emphasizes how beauty and ugliness are subjective, but I feel
			that at a certain point it tries to say that, in the end, a design is good if it manages to communicate what
			it intends to <span class="rib">communicate.</span> For example, the punk designs of the 1970s, which many might consider ugly, but
			ultimately expressed what they felt: anger, rupture, brokenness.</p>
		<p> I agree with the author that ugliness should not be treated as an end in itself or as something “trendy,”
			because this weakens design. I believe that beauty and ugliness are very subjective, but I also think there
			are some design principles that, if broken, will make something be considered ugly though that doesn’t
			necessarily mean it’s bad design. </p>
		<p> It depends on the <span class="rib">context </span>and on what is intended to be communicated. If something is well-founded and
			succeeds in communicating its message, then the design is good, regardless of whether it is considered
			beautiful or ugly.</p>
		<p> I think the text can be summed up in three types of design: Modernist design, which follows a <span class="rib">grid </span>and
			aligns with what is most universally considered “beautiful”; Postmodern design, which seeks to be more
			<span class="rib">disruptive</span> and may at times be seen as “ugly,” but still manages to communicate its message; and finally,
			the “cult of ugliness,” where ugliness becomes an end in itself, lacking meaning or purpose.</p>
